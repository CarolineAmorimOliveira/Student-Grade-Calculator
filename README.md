# Student Grade Calculator

A Python program that calculates a student’s average grade and assigns a letter grade based on standard grading thresholds. This project was developed as part of my Valencia College Dual Enrollment course, *Introduction to Programming Concepts*.

---

## 📘 Purpose
The program allows the user to:
- Enter multiple students
- Input three grades per student
- Automatically calculate the student's average
- Assign the correct letter grade (A–F)
- Display a clean summary for each student

---

## 🔍 Concepts Used
- User input handling
- Lists and loops (`for` loops)
- Creating and calling functions
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- f-strings for formatted output

---

## 🛠 How It Works
- The user chooses how many students they want to grade.
- For each student, the user enters the student’s name and three numeric grades.
- A function calculates the average.
- Another function determines the letter grade.
- The results are printed clearly for the user.
