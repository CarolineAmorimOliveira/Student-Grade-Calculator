# Student Grade Calculator

A Python program that calculates each student's average grade and assigns a letter grade based on standard grading thresholds. This project was developed as part of my Valencia College Dual Enrollment course, *Introduction to Programming Concepts*.

## 📘 Purpose
This program allows the user to:
- Enter how many students they want to evaluate
- Input each student’s name
- Record three numeric grades per student
- Calculate the student’s average
- Determine the letter grade (A–F)
- Display a clear summary for each student

---

## 🔍 Concepts Used
- User input and input validation  
- Lists and loops (`for` loops)  
- Creating and calling functions  
- Arithmetic operations for grade averaging  
- Conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- String formatting using f-strings  

---

## 🛠 How It Works
1. The user specifies how many students will be graded.  
2. For each student:
   - The program asks for the student’s name  
   - Collects three individual grades  
   - Calculates the average using a custom function  
   - Determines the letter grade using another function  
3. A summary line is printed for each student showing their average and letter grade.
